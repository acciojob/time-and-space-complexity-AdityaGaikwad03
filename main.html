  <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

  <p>
    Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the size of its input. Understanding time complexity helps in designing efficient algorithms.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. For example, an algorithm with space complexity O(n) requires memory that grows linearly with the input.
